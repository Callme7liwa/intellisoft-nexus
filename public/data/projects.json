The React frontend provides a chat interface where users can upload a dataset and describe what they want in natural language (e.g., remove duplicates, filter rows, create new columns, fix missing values, group and aggregate). Behind the scenes, a Python backend powered by LangGraph converts these instructions into safe, executable Pandas code, applies the transformations step by step, and returns both the updated data preview and a clear explanation of what changed. The system keeps a history of actions, supports iterative refinements, and can generate basic visualizations so users can quickly understand the impact of their transformations. Tervela is designed as a practical GenAI data tool: instead of writing complex scripts, users talk to the agent and let it handle the cleaning logic while still keeping full control over their data.",

The project involved collecting and preprocessing extensive datasets from past EPL seasons, including match outcomes, player injuries, transfers, and tactical formations. Leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, the model was trained to identify patterns and key indicators that influence match results. We also experimented with multiple algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ensemble techniques to compare performance.
